/*
 * The whenReady directive allows you to execute the content of a when-ready
 * attribute after the element is ready (i.e. done loading all sub directives and DOM
 * content except for things that load asynchronously like partials and images).
 *
 * Execute multiple expressions by delimiting them with a semi-colon. If there
 * is more than one expression, and the last expression evaluates to true, then
 * all expressions prior will be evaluated after all text nodes in the element
 * have been interpolated (i.e. {{placeholders}} replaced with actual values). 
 *
 * Caveats: if other directives exists on the same element as this directive
 * and destroy the element thus preventing other directives from loading, using
 * this directive won't work. The optimal way to use this is to put this
 * directive on an outer element.
 * 
 * 
 * <body data-ng-app="MyApp" data-ng-controller="BodyCtrl" data-ng-element-ready="bodyIsReady()">
 * 	   <div data-ng-element-ready="divIsReady()">...<div>
 * </body>
